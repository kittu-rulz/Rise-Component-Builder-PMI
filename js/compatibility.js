// Single source of truth for how confident this project actually is that a given
// export format works in a real host (Rise, an LMS, a plain browser). The tiers here
// are the same ones used in docs/RISE-COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md — this module is the
// UI-facing half of that classification; the doc is the narrative/testing-guidance half.
// Neither invents a claim the other doesn't also make: if you change a tier here, update
// the matching row in the matrix doc, and vice versa.

/**
 * CONFIRMED — verified by this project's own automated tests, or a recorded manual
 *             test run logged in docs/COMPATIBILITY-RESULTS.md.
 * PREVIEW   — technically built to the target's own documented capability, but never
 *             independently run against that real target by this project.
 * FALLBACK  — degrades gracefully rather than breaking outright, under a known,
 *             documented condition (e.g. only with a non-default host setting).
 * UNSUPPORTED — known not to work today, or no working implementation exists yet.
