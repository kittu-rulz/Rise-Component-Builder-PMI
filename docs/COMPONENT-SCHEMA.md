# Component schema

This document describes the data model authors edit and the contract a component must satisfy to be a first-class citizen of the registry described in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1. It supersedes the root-level `COMPONENT-SCHEMA.md`, which is now a pointer to this file.

## Current project configuration model

Projects persist a `config` object with shared component configuration plus component-specific item data:

```js
{
  blockTitle,
  blockHeadline,
  blockHeadingLevel,
  blockDesc,
  colorPrimary,
  colorAccent,
  colorBg,
  colorText,
  borderRadius,
  shadowDepth,
  borderOutline,
  accordionMulti,
  accordionAnimation,
  iconStyle,
  trackCompletion,
  completionMsg,
  themeTokens,
  items: []
}
```

Item fields are driven by `js/editor-schemas.js` (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2). A field definition can contain `id`, `label`, `type`, `default`, `required`, `requiredOne`, `groupAcrossItems`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `suffix`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `patternMessage`, `preferredDimensions`, `warningWhen`/`warningUnless`/`warningUnlessAny`/`warningMessage`, and `options`.

## Shared configuration properties

| Property        |   Type | Purpose                                                                |
| --------------- | -----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockTitle`    | string | Multiline eyebrow/category label; line breaks render in preview/export |
| `blockHeadline` | string | Multiline generated heading; line breaks render in preview/export      |
| `blockHeadingLevel` | string | HTML tag (`h1`–`h6`, default `h2`) used for the exported `blockHeadline` element — author-selectable so an embedded block doesn't force a second `h1` into a Rise lesson's own heading outline. Normalized by `js/utilities.js#normalizeHeadingLevel`; see `docs/ACCESSIBILITY-CONFORMANCE.md`. |
| `blockDesc`     | string | Learner instructions or introduction                                   |
| `items`         |  array | Ordered component-specific authoring records                           |

## Theme and style properties

| Property        |           Type | Current values                      |
| --------------- | -------------: | ----------------------------------- |
| `colorPrimary`  |     hex string | Six-digit color                     |
| `colorAccent`   |     hex string | Six-digit color                     |
| `colorBg`       |     hex string | Six-digit color                     |
| `colorText`     |     hex string | Six-digit color                     |
| `borderRadius`  | numeric string | Legacy resolved value, 0–32         |
| `shadowDepth`   |         string | `none`, `soft`, `medium`, `premium` |
| `borderOutline` |        boolean | Show/hide component borders         |
| `iconStyle`     |         string | `chevron`, `plus-minus`, `arrow`    |

These properties are synchronized from the active theme plus component overrides (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6) and remain for generator compatibility. `themeTokens` contains the resolved exported-component tokens. The builder UI mode and legacy application setting `settings.defaultFont` are separate from the exported component theme.

## Theme model

Projects store a validated theme snapshot with `schemaVersion: 1`, identity and lock metadata, timestamps, and these tokens:

```text
fontFamily, headingFontFamily, primary, primaryHover, accent,
background, surface, text, mutedText, border, success, warning,
danger, borderRadius, buttonRadius, shadow, spacingDensity,
animationSpeed
```

Supported fonts are Merriweather, Lato, Roboto, Montserrat, and Open Sans. Shadows are `none`, `soft`, `medium`, or `premium`; spacing is `compact`, `comfortable`, or `spacious`; radii are integers from 0–32 and animation speed is an integer from 0–2000 milliseconds.

`componentOverrides` may contain `primary`, `accent`, `background`, `text`, `borderRadius`, `shadow`, and `fontFamily`. Missing keys inherit the active theme. Resetting overrides removes these keys rather than copying theme values into them.

## Behavior properties

| Property               |    Type | Purpose                                                                   |

Some interaction behavior is currently fixed in `js/preview.js` rather than represented in configuration.

### Flip Cards Study mode

An optional recall-practice layer over the original Explore mode, added without changing Explore mode's own behavior — every `flipCards*` property is additive/optional, and a project saved before this feature existed loads with `flipCardsMode` effectively `'explore'`, since `components/flip-cards.js`'s generators and `validate()` treat a missing value the same as the documented default (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2; `app.js#applyMissingSchemaDefaults`/`syncEditorControls` apply the same undefined-safe fallback to the editor UI).

- **Know / Needs review** classification per card, tracked in a component-local in-memory object (not persisted, not centralized in `js/export-shell.js` — kept local for this first pass; see "Recommended schema improvements" below).
- **Category filter chips**, derived from each card's front-face `category` field, shown only when `flipCardsCategories` is on and at least one card has a non-empty category.
- **"Show Review cards only"** toggle, independent of the category filter — both can combine.
- **Live counts** ("Not viewed / Know / Review"), a summary panel once every card is classified, and an optional "Restart study set" action, all layered on top of — not replacing — the existing shared completion tracker (`viewedItems`/`updateProgress()`), which still completes exactly as before (every card flipped at least once) regardless of Know/Review state.
- **State does not persist** across a page reload and is **not** reported to Rise/an LMS beyond the existing `{ type: 'complete' }` signal (`docs/COMPLETION-INTEGRATION.md`) — Know/Review classification is a session-local study aid only.
- **Known caveat, inherited from the existing architecture, not new to this feature**: the HTML-fragment export format has no per-instance DOM scoping (`docs/EXPORT-CONTRACT.md` "CSS isolation, by format" — unique element *ids* are guaranteed, generic class-based `document.querySelectorAll(...)` calls are not). If two Flip Cards components are pasted onto the same fragment-format host page, each instance's script attaches its own listeners to every `.flip-card`/`.flip-classify-btn` element on the page, not just its own — true of the original Explore-mode implementation already, unchanged by Study mode. Prefer the Iframe Snippet or Web Package ZIP export format (structurally isolated by the `<iframe>` boundary) when multiple Flip Cards instances share one page.
- **Verified**: automated (`tests/unit/generators.test.js` hostile-input fixtures, `export-isolation`/`export-determinism`) and manual browser testing of a compiled Study-mode export (classification, counts, category filter, review-only filter, summary, restart, keyboard operability via direct event dispatch). **Not yet verified**: inside Rise's own authoring preview or a published Rise course — see `docs/RISE-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`.

### Multiple Choice Check Confidence mode

An optional layer over the original one-shot submit/feedback flow, added without changing that flow's own behavior when left off — `mcMaxAttempts` defaults to `1` (the original no-retry behavior), and every `mc*` property is additive/optional with an undefined-safe fallback in both the generator and the editor UI, so a project saved before this feature existed behaves identically.

- **Confidence self-rating** (Not sure / Somewhat sure / Very sure, all relabelable) shown before Submit when `mcConfidenceMode` is on; optionally required (`mcRequireConfidence`) before Submit is accepted.
- **Multiple attempts**, via `mcMaxAttempts` (default 1). An incorrect attempt with attempts remaining clears the selection, shows a "N attempts remaining" message, and reveals the configured hint (`mcHintText`) if one is set — it does not reveal the correct answer mid-attempt.
- **Reveal correct answer** (`mcShowCorrectAfterFinal`) — text-based ("— Correct answer"), not color-only, shown next to the correct option only after the final attempt.
- **Final explanation** (`mcFinalExplanation`) — shown once the question concludes, correct or not.
- **Confidence + correctness interpretation** (`mcShowResultSummary`, confidence mode only) — four short, deliberately supportive (not diagnostic) messages covering correct/incorrect × high/other confidence. Not a score, not reported anywhere, and not framed as a psychological or diagnostic claim.
- **Scoring is unchanged**: correctness is still the item's existing `correct` boolean; no confidence-weighted score is computed or reported — confidence only drives which interpretation message is shown.
- **Reset** (`mcAllowReset`) clears all state (selection, confidence, attempts, revealed answer) and returns focus to the first option.
- **Accessibility**: both the answer and confidence groups use `role="radiogroup"`/`role="radio"` with roving tabindex and arrow-key navigation; concluded (disabled) options are marked `aria-disabled` and removed from tab order rather than deleted, so their content remains readable; feedback receives focus on every submit so a keyboard/screen-reader user reliably lands on the result, not just on whatever triggered `aria-live`.
- **Verified**: automated (`tests/unit/generators.test.js`, `export-isolation`/`export-determinism`) and manual browser testing of a compiled Confidence-mode export — validation gating (no option/no confidence), retry with hint, correct/incorrect × confidence interpretation text, reveal-correct-after-final, reset, and the concluded/disabled state. **Not yet verified**: inside Rise's own authoring preview or a published Rise course.

### Accordion Guided mode

An optional layer over the original free-exploration accordion, added without changing that mode's own behavior when left off — every `accordion*` guided-mode property is additive/optional, so a project saved before this feature existed behaves identically.

- **Sequential/guided unlocking** (`accordionSequential`) — panel *N+1* stays locked (visually marked with a lock icon and an explanatory note, `aria-disabled` on its trigger, removed from tab order) until panel *N* has been opened at least once. Built directly on the existing `viewedItems` set every component already shares (`js/export-shell.js`) — opening a panel that was already going to mark it "viewed" is what unlocks the next one, no separate tracking state.
- **Progress indicator** (`accordionShowProgress`, "N of M explored") and **per-panel Visited badge** (`accordionShowVisitedBadge`) — both independent of `trackCompletion`; they reflect the same `viewedItems` set the (optional) shared completion tracker uses, but render even when completion tracking itself is off.
- **Search** (`accordionSearch`) — filters panels by title *and* body text (plain substring match against each panel's rendered text), announces the match count, and a "Clear" button restores every panel without altering which ones were already opened/visited.
- **Learner-facing Expand All / Collapse All** (`accordionExpandCollapseAll`) — only rendered when `accordionMulti` is on and `accordionSequential` is off, since both a single-open accordion and a locked sequence make "expand everything" incoherent. Reuses the existing per-panel open/close function directly rather than a parallel code path, so it can never drift out of sync with a manual click.
- **Reset** (`accordionAllowReset`) — clears `viewedItems`, closes every panel, re-locks sequential panels back to only-the-first-unlocked, clears any active search, and returns focus to the first panel's trigger.
- **Accessibility**: locked triggers carry `aria-disabled="true"` and `aria-describedby` pointing at a visible "Locked — open the previous section first" note (not just a color/opacity change); unlocking a panel never moves focus (the note simply becomes able to be reached, focus stays wherever the learner already was); all new controls are real `<button>`/`<input type="search">` elements.
- **Verified**: automated (`tests/unit/generators.test.js`, `export-isolation`/`export-determinism`) and manual browser testing of two compiled exports — sequential mode (lock/unlock progression, locked-click rejection, progress text, visited badges, reset) and free-exploration mode with search + Expand All/Collapse All (filtering, match count, clear, bulk expand/collapse). **Not yet verified**: inside Rise's own authoring preview or a published Rise course.

### Horizontal Tabs Guided mode, orientation, and comparison

An optional layer over the original free-navigation tabs, added without changing that mode's own behavior when left off — every `tabs*` property is additive/optional, so a project saved before this feature existed behaves identically. Uses the exact same sequential-lock/progress/visited-badge/reset design as Accordion's Guided mode above, built on the same shared `viewedItems` set.

- **Sequential unlocking** (`tabsSequential`), **progress indicator** (`tabsShowProgress`), **Visited badge** (`tabsShowVisitedBadge`), and **Reset** (`tabsAllowReset`) — same semantics and same shared-state approach as Accordion's Guided mode.
- **Numbered steps** (`tabsNumbered`) — prefixes each tab label with its 1-based position, decorative (`aria-hidden`) since the accessible tab order already conveys sequence.
- **Optional per-tab icon** — new `iconImage`/`iconAltText`/`iconDecorative`/`iconFit` item fields (the same shared `visualIconFields` used by Flip Cards and Info Grid). No built-in fallback icon is shown when unset — unlike Flip Cards' decorative default, a tab's icon is a pure enhancement with no icon by default.
- **Vertical orientation** (`tabsOrientation: 'vertical'`) — sets `aria-orientation="vertical"` on the tablist and lays the tab list beside (not above) the panel via CSS only; automatically falls back to the original horizontal strip layout below 480px viewport width via a plain media query, so no DOM is duplicated for the responsive case.
- **Comparison mode** (`tabsCompareMode`) — a "Compare Sections" toggle reveals an independent checkbox group (up to 2 selections, further checkboxes disable once 2 are picked) rendering the two chosen tabs' content side by side (2 columns ≥600px, stacked below). Deliberately built as a *separate* widget alongside the normal tablist rather than mutating tab/tabpanel roles or allowing two simultaneously "selected" tabs — a tablist has exactly one active tab per the WAI-ARIA pattern, and comparison mode doesn't change that; it's a second, independent view of the same content. Selecting comparison checkboxes does not affect `viewedItems`/progress — comparison is treated as a separate lens on already-authored content, not a new interaction to track.
- **Verified**: automated (`tests/unit/generators.test.js`, `export-isolation`/`export-determinism`) and manual browser testing of two compiled exports — sequential mode with numbered steps (lock/unlock progression, locked-click rejection, progress, visited badges, reset) and vertical orientation with comparison mode (checkbox selection/limit/uncheck, column rendering, orientation attribute and layout). **Not yet verified**: inside Rise's own authoring preview or a published Rise course, and the narrow-screen orientation fallback specifically was verified by reading the compiled CSS rather than an actual narrow-viewport render (the test tooling's viewport resize wasn't taking effect against this compiled fixture in this session) — the media query itself is standard, unambiguous CSS, but a real narrow-viewport visual check is still worth doing before treating it as fully confirmed.

### Vertical Timeline: categories, comparison, guided reveal

Scoped to `vertical-timeline` only (Horizontal Journey Map is untouched — its slide-one-panel-at-a-time interaction doesn't fit a side-by-side comparison the way a vertical list does; adding this to it later would need its own design pass, not a copy of this one). An optional layer over the original free-browsing timeline, added without changing that mode's own behavior when left off — every `timeline*` field is additive/optional, so a project saved before this feature existed behaves identically.

- **New optional `category` item field** — the only schema addition, since neither timeline component had a date/category field before this (`docs/COMPONENT-SCHEMA.md`'s own prior audit note). Used for both the filter chips and comparison mode.
- **Category filter chips** (`timelineCategoriesEnabled`) — "All" plus one chip per distinct category found; each step also carries a visible text badge with its own category (never color- or position-only), satisfying the requirement that a step's stream stay identifiable however it's laid out.
- **Two-stream comparison** (`timelineCompareMode`, requires `timelineCategoriesEnabled` and ≥2 distinct categories authored) — a fixed, author-configured split (not a learner picker, unlike Tabs' comparison mode): every step whose category matches the first category found goes in stream A, everything else goes in stream B, labeled with the real category text (never "Stream A"/"B"). No step is ever silently dropped. 2-column CSS grid ≥600px, single column below that — collapsing to "a clear stacked sequence" is pure CSS (no DOM duplication), each step still carrying its own category badge in the stacked view since column position alone no longer indicates stream once stacked. Falls back to the normal single-track list if fewer than 2 categories are set, rather than rendering a broken comparison.
- **Chronological reveal** (`timelineChronologicalReveal`) — same lock/unlock design as Accordion/Tabs Guided mode, applied to timeline steps.
- **Collapsible step details** (`timelineCollapsibleDetails`) — steps start collapsed; expanding one is also what marks it "viewed." Uses a real `<button aria-expanded>` in this mode instead of the original's `role="listitem"`/`aria-pressed` toggle pattern, since a genuine expand/collapse interaction is a better semantic fit than a highlight-only toggle — the original pattern is preserved byte-for-byte when this option is off.
- **Progress indicator** (`timelineShowProgress`) and **Reset** (`timelineAllowReset`) — same shared-`viewedItems` design as the other three Guided-mode enhancements.
- **Verified**: automated (`tests/unit/generators.test.js`, `export-isolation`/`export-determinism`) and manual browser testing of three compiled exports — chronological reveal + collapsible + progress + reset (lock/unlock progression, expand-marks-viewed, progress text, reset), category filtering (badge display, filter, match announcement), and two-stream comparison (correct split by category, no dropped steps, real 2-column CSS grid, narrow-screen media query present in compiled CSS). **Not yet verified**: inside Rise's own authoring preview or a published Rise course, and — as with Tabs' orientation fallback — the narrow-screen comparison-layout collapse was confirmed by reading the compiled CSS rather than an actual narrow-viewport render, for the same tooling-limitation reason.

## Completion tracking

| Property          |    Type | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------: | ------------------------------------- |
| `trackCompletion` | boolean | Enables generated progress tracking   |
| `completionMsg`   |  string | Screen-reader completion announcement |

The preview runtime calculates trackable counts per component. Content-reveal components generally complete after all items are viewed; assessments complete on success; media completes on the `ended` event. Completion also triggers the completion adapter described in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §11 and `docs/COMPLETION-INTEGRATION.md`, which sends a versioned outbound message only when the component is actually embedded in a host page.

Rich text is supported for selected content fields and sanitized to an allowlist before rendering (`docs/SECURITY.md`).

Hotspots additionally use component-level fields: `backgroundImage`, `backgroundAltText`, `backgroundDecorative`, `backgroundFit`, `backgroundFocalX`, and `backgroundFocalY`.

`audio-player` additionally uses component-level fields: `presentationMode` (`compact`/`learning`/`podcast`), `chapters` and `transcriptSegments` (delimited text — see `docs/AUDIO-PLAYER.md` "Data model" for the exact syntax and why a delimited field rather than a nested repeatable list), `progressPersistence`, `takeaways`, and `takeawaysVisibility`.

`video-frame` additionally uses component-level fields: `chapters` and `transcriptSegments` (same delimited-text syntax as `audio-player` — `MM:SS | Title | Description` and `MM:SS | Speaker | Text`, one entry per line), `progressPersistence`, `takeaways`, and `takeawaysVisibility`. Chapters here are navigation/scrub-bar markers only — there is no branching, quiz-gating, or hotspot layer; that richer authoring path remains `interactive-video`'s alone (`docs/INTERACTIVE-VIDEO.md`). The per-item `transcript` field is the plain-text fallback shown when no `transcriptSegments` are authored, and is otherwise independent of the pre-existing `audioDescription` disclosure, which video-frame keeps unchanged.

## Media reference model

External media remains a validated HTTP(S) URL string. A local upload is represented in configuration as JSON-safe metadata:

```js
{
  source: ('upload', mediaId, schemaVersion, kind, name, mimeType, size, createdAt, duration);
}
```

The corresponding IndexedDB record (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9) additionally contains the Blob and editable metadata fields. Object URLs are created only at runtime and are not part of the schema.

For optional custom item artwork, an empty `iconImage` means "use the built-in icon." Removing an upload therefore restores the default without storing a separate reset flag. Meaningful artwork uses `iconAltText`; decorative artwork sets `iconDecorative: true`. `iconFit` accepts `contain` or `cover`.

All image fields define advisory `preferredDimensions`: 256×256 for custom icons, 800×800 for profile images, 1600×900 for hotspot backgrounds, 1280×720 for video posters, and 1600×1200 for gallery images. The upload control also lists JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, and GIF as supported formats. Existing 10 MB image and 2 MB SVG limits remain enforced independently of the preferred dimensions (configurable in Builder Settings; see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9).

## Component registry contract

To be registered in `componentRegistry` (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1), a component module must export exactly:

```text
id                          string, matches its js/catalog.js entry id
name                        string, display name
category                    string, matches its js/catalog.js entry category
defaultConfig                object, the item/config defaults for a new instance
editorSchema                object, same shape as js/editor-schemas.js entries
generateHTML(config)         → string
generateCSS(config)          → string
generateJS(config)           → string
validate(config)             → { valid: boolean, errors: string[] }
```

**Stale note, corrected**: this paragraph previously said only six components were modular, with the rest implemented as conditional branches in `js/preview.js`/`app.js`. That migration is complete — all 21 catalog components are real modules exporting this exact contract (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1, `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` "Coupling and duplication... resolved"), and there is no legacy dispatch branch left anywhere. **No new component-specific special-casing should be added to `preview.js`/`app.js`; a new component is added directly to the registry contract above,** the same way `interactive-video` (`docs/INTERACTIVE-VIDEO.md`) and this feature's own `audio-player` additions (`docs/AUDIO-PLAYER.md`) were.

The automated generator-contract test suite (`tests/unit/generators.test.js`) exercises 20 of the 21 modular components — every one whose items share the uniform `{title, content}`-shaped assumption this test's shared loop makes — with empty, one-item, many-item, long-text, emoji, multilingual, right-to-left, quote, closing-script, and unsafe-URL fixtures. It parses generated HTML, checks id uniqueness within an instance, parses CSS, compiles JavaScript, and rejects accidental `undefined` or object-string output. `interactive-video` has its own dedicated equivalent (`tests/unit/interactive-video.test.js`) instead, since its type-discriminated, optionally-empty marker list doesn't fit that shared loop's assumptions. Any newly added component should gain the same fixture coverage (`docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`).

## Catalog positioning: classification and differentiator

Every catalog entry (`js/component-registry.js#fromModule`'s options, alongside `description`/`keywords`/`icon`) also carries two required, author-facing fields, surfaced on the template-selection card (`js/catalog.js#createCatalogCard`) so an author can tell at a glance how a component differs from what Rise already offers natively — this is presentation-only catalog metadata, not part of a project's saved `config` and not something an author edits per-instance.

**The two classifications** (`js/component-registry.js#CLASSIFICATIONS`):

- **`enhanced` → "Enhanced Rise Alternative"** — Rise has a broadly similar native block, and this builder's version adds branding, presentation, or learning behaviour on top of that same basic interaction (e.g. Accordion, Multiple Choice Check, Sorting Drag-and-Drop).
- **`custom` → "Advanced Custom Interaction"** — the component is a purpose-built layout or learning experience with no single native Rise block equivalent (e.g. Interactive Learning Audio, Custom Video Embed, Product Matrix Cards).

Deliberately never "Rise Unique" or any other absolute-uniqueness phrasing — a future Rise release could add a native equivalent, which would make an absolute claim like that inaccurate; "Advanced Custom Interaction" describes what the component *is* (a purpose-built interaction), not a permanent claim about Rise's own roadmap.

**How the classification is determined**: judgment, made once per component at the time it's added to the registry, against the test above — "does an author already have a native Rise block that does roughly this, just less branded?" (→ `enhanced`) vs. "would an author have to build this from several native blocks bolted together, or not be able to build it at all?" (→ `custom`). It is not derived from `categoryId` (a separate, pre-existing sidebar grouping — `CATEGORIES` in the same file — that this classification is deliberately independent of, including sharing no id strings with it) or from any other schema property; there's no way to compute it from the component's own code.

**Where it's maintained**: both `classification` and `differentiator` are set inline as options on each `fromModule(...)` call in `js/component-registry.js#COMPONENT_REGISTRY` — the single source of truth. `js/catalog.js` resolves `classification`'s id to its display name (`classificationLabel`) and carries `differentiator` through onto the plain object each template card renders from; neither is duplicated or hand-maintained anywhere else. The classification badge and "Why use it?" text are rendered by `js/catalog.js#createCatalogCard`; their visual treatment lives in `styles.css` under `.card-classification-badge`/`.card-classification-enhanced`/`.card-classification-custom`/`.card-why*`.

**Requirement for every future component**: `validateRegistry()` (`js/component-registry.js`, run automatically at module load against the live `COMPONENT_REGISTRY`, and callable against any candidate registry) throws if `classification` isn't one of the two known ids, or if `differentiator` is missing/empty — so a new component genuinely cannot ship without both. `differentiator` should stay a single, concrete, concise sentence (see the existing 21 for tone and length) describing what an author specifically gains over the native Rise equivalent — it renders in full, always visible, never truncated or hidden behind a hover/disclosure control (`tests/unit/component-registry.test.js`'s "catalog-positioning metadata" suite, `tests/unit/catalog-card.test.js`).

## Recommended schema improvements

**Planned, not yet implemented:**

- Add stable item IDs so media ownership and reordering do not depend on array position.
- Add component-level schema sections in addition to `itemFields` more broadly (today `hotspots`, `interactive-video`, and `audio-player` use `componentFields`; every other component's fields are all `itemFields`).
- Add conditional schema visibility so decorative images can hide or disable alternative-text inputs. `interactive-video` hits this same gap from a different angle: both marker types' full field sets (Information's `body` vs. Multiple Choice's `question`/answers/feedback) are always visible in every marker's editor card regardless of its selected `type`, since there is no per-value conditional field visibility to hide the irrelevant set (`docs/INTERACTIVE-VIDEO.md` "Authoring workflow").
- Add a schema field type for a nested, repeatable sub-list within an item — every field today is scalar. `interactive-video`'s Multiple Choice markers hit this directly: answers are a fixed 4 flat slots (`answer1Label`…`answer4Label`) rather than an unbounded list, chosen as the lower-risk option over a delimited-text encoding precisely because this capability doesn't exist yet (`docs/INTERACTIVE-VIDEO.md` "Marker data model" "Known limitation, deliberate").
- Separate warnings from blocking validation errors more formally in the schema shape (today this is convention — `warningWhen`/`warningUnless`/`warningUnlessAny` vs. `required` — not an enforced separation).
- Add schema migrations per component when new fields are introduced (today only the project-level `schemaVersion` migrates; component item shapes do not version independently).
- Complete registry modularization (§ above) so every generator owns its defaults, schema, validation, and output.
