# Architecture

This document describes the implementation currently present in the repository and defines the module boundaries the project is expected to keep going forward. It supersedes the root-level `ARCHITECTURE.md`, which is now a pointer to this file. Recommendations that are not yet implemented are explicitly labeled **Planned**; everything else describes shipped behavior.

Rise Component Builder is intentionally framework-free: vanilla HTML5, vanilla CSS, and native browser ES modules, with no bundler, backend, or database. `npm` exists only for pinned dev tooling (tests, linting, type-checking, and a static-file production build). This document's job is to keep that simplicity from turning into an unmaintainable single-file application as the component count grows — by drawing hard lines between the eleven areas below and saying, module by module, which file owns which responsibility.

## Application initialization flow

1. `index.html` loads `app.js` as an ES module — the only `<script>` tag in the document, and the only module Node/browser tooling needs to treat as an entry point.
2. `app.js` imports state, storage, catalog, editor, preview, export, utility, toast, and the modular component registry.
3. On `DOMContentLoaded`, persisted application UI theme, settings, favorites, custom themes, and the default component theme are loaded from `js/storage.js`.
4. DOM references and event handlers are registered.
5. `init()` applies the application UI theme, synchronizes settings, renders the catalog, and restores a valid autosaved draft when available.
6. Selecting a component initializes its default items, renders the schema-driven editor, and writes a generated document to the preview iframe via the **same compiler** used for export (§4/§5).

## Project identity, save status, and unsaved-work guards (P08)

`appState.isDirty` (`js/state.js`) tracks whether meaningful project data (config, theme, component overrides) has changed since the last successful save/open/new — never transient UI state (preview device, open panels, search/category filters), since those never call `updateLivePreview()`, the single place `isDirty` gets set `true`. It resets to `false` in exactly three places: a successful `performSave()`, a successful `applyProject()` (opening a saved project or restoring a draft), and `performNewProject()`. The header's `#project-status` (`app.js#updateProjectStatusDisplay`) reads it directly: no backing saved project (`currentProjectId === null`) always shows "Unsaved changes" regardless of `isDirty`'s raw value (there's nothing yet to have drifted from); otherwise it shows "Saved" only when `isDirty` is also false.

**Protected navigation paths** — each calls `guardUnsavedChanges()` before proceeding when `isDirty` is true, offering Save/Discard/Cancel (`openConfirmDialog`'s `extraLabel` option, added for this):
- New Project (`btn-new`)
- Back to Templates (`btn-back-to-catalog`)
- Loading a different saved project (`Load`, inside the Open Project picker — guarding the picker's *open* button itself was considered and rejected, since merely browsing saved projects without loading one loses nothing)
- Browser/tab close (`beforeunload` — the one guard that can't use the custom modal, since a page mid-unload can't await a promise; sets `event.returnValue` instead, which triggers the browser's own native prompt)

Choosing "Save" from the guard opens the existing save dialog and defers the original action (`pendingActionAfterSave`) until that save actually succeeds — cancelling the save dialog instead discards the pending action rather than silently running it later on some unrelated future save. A failed save (validation error, storage failure) never closes the dialog or clears `isDirty`, so nothing is ever discarded on a failed save.

Autosave (`scheduleDraftSave`/`saveCurrentDraft`, 700ms debounce) is unaffected by any of this — it keeps writing to its own separate `localStorage` draft slot regardless of `isDirty`, exactly as before P08. The two systems answer different questions: autosave asks "is there a recovery copy on disk," `isDirty` asks "does the author still need to make a decision before this navigation/close proceeds."

## Component discovery and long-editor polish (P11)

**Recently Used** — `js/storage.js`'s `KEYS.recentlyUsed` (`rise-builder-recently-used-v1`) stores a plain array of component ids, most-recently-used first, capped at `RECENTLY_USED_LIMIT` (8). `withRecentlyUsedEntry(list, id)` is the single place that mutates it: it moves an existing id to the front rather than storing a duplicate, and drops the oldest entry once the cap is exceeded. This key has no separate schema version of its own — it's a small, self-describing array (not an object with fields that could gain/lose meaning over time the way a project record can), so a version bump was judged unnecessary; if its shape ever needs to change, treat an unrecognized array as empty rather than trying to migrate it.

Recording happens exactly once per selection, in `app.js#recordRecentlyUsed(componentId)`, called from exactly two places: `loadComponentToEditor()` (picking a component from the catalog) and `syncEditorControls()` (opening or restoring a saved project/draft). It is deliberately **not** called on every edit, save, or re-render — "recently used" means "recently opened," not "recently touched." The sidebar's "Recently Used" category (`data-category="recent"`) reads this list through `filterCatalog` (`js/catalog.js`), which orders results by the list's own recency order rather than catalog order — the entire point of the category would be defeated by re-sorting it back to alphabetical/registry order.

**Default item collapse** — a freshly-populated item list (a new component selected, or a project/draft opened) starts with only its first item expanded; the rest start collapsed (`js/editor.js#createSchemaItemEditor`'s `resetToDefaultCollapse`). This is called from exactly the same two call sites as recording a recent-use entry, and only those two — never from `render()` itself or any other re-render path (a field edit, add/duplicate/delete, a settings save) — so it never overwrites collapse/expand choices the user already made this session. New items (via Add Item or Duplicate) still default to expanded, unchanged from before P11, since the user likely wants to see what they just created. "Expand all"/"Collapse all" buttons next to the item list (`#btn-expand-all-items`/`#btn-collapse-all-items`) bulk-toggle every item at once.

**Focus preservation** — reordering, duplicating, deleting, or collapsing/expanding an item, and clearing an empty-result search, all fully rebuild the DOM they touch (`js/editor.js#render()`'s `container.innerHTML = ''`, or the catalog grid's own re-render), which would otherwise silently drop keyboard focus to `<body>`. Each handler sets a `pendingFocus` target (item index + which control) immediately before triggering the rebuild; `render()` resolves and applies it once the new DOM exists, falling back to a caller-supplied `focusFallback` element (the "Add Item" button) when the target no longer exists — e.g. deleting the only remaining item. The catalog's "Clear search" button (shown in the empty-results state) hands focus back to the search input for the same reason, since clicking it destroys the button itself.

**Category controls are `<button>`s, not links** (`index.html`'s `.nav-item`s) — they filter the catalog in place rather than navigating anywhere, so a real `<button type="button">` is the correct semantic element; the earlier `<a href="#">` markup required a `click` handler to call `preventDefault()` purely to suppress navigation that was never actually wanted.

**Length guidance** — `js/field-validation.js#getLengthGuidance(field)` returns a short, always-visible note for text/select/textarea/richtext fields that have no explicit `maxLength` (fields that already declare one are already hard-capped at save time and don't need it). It is guidance only — it never adds a `maxLength` attribute or blocks typing — and shares its two length thresholds (`RECOMMENDED_TEXT_LENGTH` = 200, `RECOMMENDED_RICH_LENGTH` = 4000) with `js/validation.js`'s pre-existing `general-excessive-length` Preflight rule, so the inline hint shown while typing and the later save/export-time warning agree on the same numbers.

## Initial selection state and export readiness (P12)

**What "the accordion on entry" actually was.** `appState.config` (`js/state.js`) has always defaulted to a real, populated accordion configuration — there is no other sensible initial shape for a config object that many other functions read unconditionally. But a genuinely fresh launch (no saved draft) never *selects* that accordion: `appState.selectedComponent` stays `null`, and the static catalog screen (`#catalog-state`, no inline style) is what's actually visible — `#editor-state` starts `display: none` in `index.html`. The accordion default was never shown to the user as "the current component" on a bare launch; it only leaked in through two gaps this prompt closed:

1. The live preview panel (`.preview-panel`) is a permanent sibling of `#catalog-state`/`#editor-state`, not hidden by `showState()` — so `updateLivePreview()`'s old unconditional `writePreview(...)` call rendered the sample accordion's compiled HTML into it even on a bare catalog screen, visually contradicting the catalog's own "Select a Component Template" empty state right next to it.
2. `runExportPreflightGate()`'s `!container || !context` branch fail-opened (`setExportActionsEnabled(true)`) whenever `buildPreflightContext()` returned `null` — which it does specifically when nothing is selected — conflating "the preflight check itself is broken" (a real reason to fail open, so a tooling bug never bricks a working export) with "there's nothing to check because nothing is selected" (which should fail *closed*).

**Chosen model: Option A — no component selected by default, an explicit empty state, Export/Save disabled.** Not Option B (auto-load the accordion as a labeled "sample" requiring an explicit "Use this component" action): the app already defaults to the catalog screen with nothing selected on a fresh launch, so Option A required closing two leaks rather than introducing a new "sample" concept and a new confirmation step the rest of the app (favorites, recently used, search) isn't built around.

**`appState.selectedComponent` is the single source of truth** for "is there a real component currently loaded to save/export," checked in exactly one place per concern:
- `updateToolbarActionAvailability()` (called from every `showState()` transition) disables `#btn-save`/`#btn-export` and swaps their `title`/`aria-label` to explain why, whenever it's `null`.
- `updatePreviewEmptyState()` (same call site) shows `#preview-empty-state` instead of `#live-preview-iframe`.
- `updateLivePreview()` now returns immediately after that empty-state toggle when nothing is selected — it never compiles or writes preview content for a phantom selection.
- `runExportPreflightGate()` now fails *closed* (`Select a component before exporting.`, actions disabled) specifically when `buildPreflightContext()` returns `null`, separately from the unchanged fail-*open* catch-block for a genuinely broken preflight run.

**Every path that reaches either screen goes through this the same way** (Requirement 5): a fresh launch, `performNewProject()`, and `performBackToCatalog()` (which now also clears `appState.selectedComponent` — previously it left the stale value in place, the one real behavior change here) all land on the catalog with nothing selected. Picking a catalog card (`loadComponentToEditor`) and opening/restoring a saved project or draft (`applyProject` → `syncEditorControls`) both set `selectedComponent` before showing the editor. None of favorites, recently used, template category filtering, or project import bypass these two functions — they're all just different ways of arriving at the same `component-select-card` click or `applyProject` call already covered above.

**Blocking vs. Warning vs. Recommendation is unchanged** — `docs/VALIDATION-RULES.md` already documents and enforces the decision this requirement asked for: `canExport = blocking.length === 0`, so only Blocking issues gate export; Warnings and Recommendations are advisory and never disable the Export modal's actions. That policy predates P12 and was reviewed, not altered, by it.

## The eleven architectural boundaries

Each boundary below names the file(s) that own it, what may cross the boundary, and what must not.

### 1. Component registry

**Owns:** `js/component-registry.js` (catalog metadata: description, keywords, version, icon, status, media/accessibility/completion flags) + `components/*.js` (behavior: `id`, `name`, `category`, `defaultConfig`, `editorSchema`, `generateHTML`, `generateCSS`, `generateJS`, `validate`). `js/catalog.js` is a thin UI-facing adapter over the registry (search/filter/card rendering); it owns no data of its own.

**All 21 catalog components are real modules implementing the full five-function contract** — there is no legacy dispatch branch anywhere. `js/component-registry.js` builds `COMPONENT_REGISTRY` by importing every `components/*.js` module (`fromModule(...)`); `app.js` derives the id → renderer map the compiler needs, plus each entry's `validate`, from that single registry:

```js
const componentRegistry = Object.fromEntries(
  COMPONENT_REGISTRY.map(entry => [entry.id, { ...entry.renderer, validate: entry.validate }])
);
```

`validateRegistry()` (`js/component-registry.js`) runs once at module load and throws immediately — naming the offending component and field — on a duplicate id, an unknown category, a missing renderer function, or any other malformed entry, so a broken registry fails fast in development rather than silently misrendering.

**Rule going forward:** a component is only ever added by giving it a full `components/*.js` module (the five-function/`defaultConfig`/`editorSchema` shape) and a `js/component-registry.js` entry. Nothing outside `components/*.js` and `js/component-registry.js` should need to know a component's id to add support for it — there is no special-form escape hatch left to extend.

### 2. Component data / schema

**Owns:** `js/editor-schemas.js` (per-component `itemFields`/`componentFields`, `minItems`, `itemLabel`) and each of the 21 component modules' own `editorSchema`/`defaultConfig` export.

A schema is data, not behavior: a list of field descriptors (`id`, `label`, `type`, `default`, `required`, `min`/`max`, `pattern`, `options`, …). `js/catalog.js` attaches the resolved schema to each catalog entry via `getEditorSchema(componentId)`. `createDefaultItem(schema)` derives a blank item purely from that schema. Full schema field semantics live in `docs/COMPONENT-SCHEMA.md`.

**Rule:** schema files never touch the DOM and never generate HTML/CSS/JS strings. They describe shape and constraints only; `js/editor.js` (§3) and `js/preview.js` (§4/§5) are the only consumers allowed to act on that shape.

### 3. Component editor configuration (authoring UI)

**Owns:** `js/editor.js` (generic schema-driven rendering: item cards, add/duplicate/delete/move/drag-reorder/collapse, per-field controls and inline errors) and `js/media-upload.js` (the reusable browse/drop/preview control used wherever a schema field has type `image`/`audio`/`video` or a `uploadKind`).

`app.js` supplies `appState.config.items` plus the active schema to `createSchemaItemEditor({ container, onChange })` and receives a generic `onChange` callback that triggers re-preview and draft persistence. Shared header/style/behavior fields (block title, colors, radius, behavior toggles) remain static markup in `index.html`, synchronized directly by `app.js` — they are not schema-driven because every component shares the same set of them.

**Rule:** `js/editor.js` never knows a specific `componentId`. It only knows field _types_ (`supportedEditorFieldTypes`) and the generic schema shape from §2. Component-specific authoring logic belongs in a component module's own code.

### 4. Preview rendering

**Owns:** `js/preview.js` → `generateIframeContent(appState, componentRegistry, colorToRgba)` (orchestration) + `js/export-shell.js` (the shared shell/tokens/accessibility layer it composes).

`generateIframeContent()` is the single HTML/CSS/JS document compiler for the whole application, and it is now a thin orchestrator over the modular pipeline documented in full in `docs/EXPORT-CONTRACT.md`:

1. Resolves the active theme + component overrides into token values (`js/themes.js`, §6).
2. Sanitizes the component configuration for the selected `componentId` (`sanitizePreviewConfig`, `js/utilities.js`, §10) — the single sanitization boundary every component module's input has already passed through.
3. Looks up `componentRegistry[componentId]` (§1 — always found; there is no fallback branch) and computes a deterministic `instanceId` from the current project id.
4. Calls that component's own `generateHTML(config, instanceId)`, `generateCSS()`, and `generateJS(config, instanceId)` — only the active component's markup/CSS/JS are ever included.
5. Passes those pieces to `js/export-shell.js#renderShell()`, which assembles the complete document — CSP meta tag, fonts, shared design tokens, shared reset/accessibility CSS, block header, completion tracker, the component's own `<style>` content, and a single combined `<script>` IIFE (shared accessibility utilities + the component's own JS) — and returns it as a string.
6. Live-preview callers write that string to `iframe.srcdoc` via `writePreview()`; the "pop out preview" affordance opens a new window and calls `document.write()` on the identical string via `openPreview()`.

**Rule — no forking:** `generateIframeContent()` is also the function §5 (export) calls. There must never be a second code path that independently re-implements a component's markup for export. If export needs something preview doesn't (e.g. asset URL rewriting), that transform is applied to preview's _output_, never by re-deriving markup from `appState` a second time. See `docs/EXPORT-CONTRACT.md` for the exact contract this guarantees.

**Preview device modes.** `js/device-preview.js` defines the fixed list of device widths the builder chrome offers (Desktop, Tablet 768px, Large Mobile 430px, Mobile 375px). Selecting one toggles a class on `#preview-viewport` (`.preview-viewport-wrapper`, `styles.css`) that sets a real CSS `width` on the wrapper the `<iframe>` lives inside — this is genuine layout width, not a `transform: scale()` visual trick, so any `@media` query a component's `generateCSS`/legacy branch ever authors will correctly react to it. The wrapper is a flex item, so it must carry `flex-shrink: 0` (plus a `max-width: 100%` safety clamp) or the flexbox algorithm silently shrinks it below its declared width whenever the preview panel itself is narrower than the requested device width — this was the original cause of "Mobile View doesn't reliably constrain to 375px" (the panel could be narrower than 375px at realistic window sizes, and both `.app-workspace` and `.preview-container` set `overflow: hidden`, so the shrink never surfaced as a scrollbar). Desktop mode caps at `min(100%, var(--component-max-width))`, where `--component-max-width` is set from `COMPONENT_MAX_WIDTH` (`js/preview.js`) — the same constant the generated document's own `.rise-block-wrapper { max-width }` uses, so "Desktop" always matches how wide an authored block can actually render, never wider. The selected mode is persisted (`loadPreviewDevice`/`savePreviewDevice`, `js/storage.js`) and, by design, is **not** reset when switching components — it reflects the author's current testing intent for the session, not a per-component default.

### 5. Export rendering

**Owns:** `js/export.js` (`buildExportPayload`, `prepareMediaExport`, `downloadHtml`, `downloadProjectJson`, `downloadAssetManifest`) plus `build.mjs` at the repo root (the _application's own_ production build — a distinct, unrelated concept from "exporting a generated component"; see the note at the end of this section).

`js/export.js` never generates component markup itself. It receives the already-compiled HTML string from §4 (`generateIframeContent()`, called once by `app.js` and passed in) and:

- wraps it as a `srcdoc` iframe embed snippet (`buildExportPayload`),
- extracts a paste-friendly `<style>`/body fragment (`generateHtmlFragment`, `js/utilities.js`),
- rewrites uploaded-media references into inlined data URLs (small raster images only) or `assets/...` relative paths plus a manifest (`prepareMediaExport`, reading Blobs from §9),
- and triggers browser downloads for standalone HTML, project JSON, or the asset manifest.

Full behavior, including the current single-file inlining limits and SCORM's out-of-scope status (ZIP export is real, not a placeholder — see `docs/MEDIA-ASSET-PIPELINE.md`), is specified in `docs/EXPORT-CONTRACT.md`.

**Note on `build.mjs`:** this new script (added for this phase) assembles the _builder application itself_ into `dist/` for static hosting (GitHub Pages). It is unrelated to a user's exported _component_ output — it does not run the preview compiler, does not touch `appState`, and does not change what ships inside a user's downloaded HTML. See "Build" further down in this document.

### 6. Shared design tokens

**Owns:** `js/themes.js`.

This is the single source of truth for the theme schema (`schemaVersion`, identity/lock metadata, timestamps, and the token set: `fontFamily`, `headingFontFamily`, 9 color tokens, `borderRadius`, `buttonRadius`, `shadow`, `spacingDensity`, `animationSpeed`), the 7 built-in presets, per-component override resolution (`resolveThemeTokens`), the legacy-property bridge (`applyThemeToConfig`, which maps tokens onto the `colorPrimary`/`colorAccent`/`colorBg`/`colorText`/`borderRadius`/`shadowDepth` properties the generators still read), and WCAG AA contrast evaluation (`validateThemeContrast` — advisory, never auto-applied).

**Rule:** no other module invents a color, radius, shadow, spacing, or font value outside this token set. `js/preview.js` and `js/utilities.js` (`sanitizeCSSColor`/`sanitizeCSSNumber`) only ever clamp/validate values that themes.js already defined as valid shapes — they do not introduce new design values of their own.

### 7. Shared accessibility utilities

**Owns:** cross-cutting, split by concern:

- **Shared completion/progress accessibility** (the `announce`/`updateProgress`/`updateTrackerComplete`/`setProgressAccessibility` functions, the `.sr-only`/focus-visible/`prefers-reduced-motion`/`forced-colors` CSS) live in `js/export-shell.js#renderSharedA11yScript`/`SHARED_A11Y_CSS` — one implementation every component calls into, not duplicated per component.
- **Structural/semantic accessibility specific to one component** (ARIA roles/states, keyboard handling, focus management for that component's own interaction pattern — e.g. roving tabindex in tabs/timeline, `aria-expanded` on the accordion) is generated inside that component module's own `generateHTML`/`generateJS` (`components/*.js`). Each of the 21 components owns its own ARIA wiring; there is no legacy branch left outside this pattern.
- **Authoring-time accessibility guidance** (alt-text/decorative warnings, transcript/caption warnings) lives in `js/media.js` (`validateMediaAccessibility`) — always advisory `warnings`, never a blocking error, surfaced by `app.js`/`js/editor.js` next to the relevant field.
- **Contrast evaluation** lives in `js/themes.js` (§6).
- **Escaping that keeps assistive-technology-relevant text safe to render** (rich text, attributes) lives in `js/utilities.js` (§10).

### 8. Project persistence

**Owns:** `js/storage.js` (+ `js/state.js` for the in-memory shape it persists).

Versioned localStorage (`schemaVersion: 2`, migrating v0/v1 projects on read). Owns project CRUD (`saveProject`/`getProject`/`deleteProject`/`renameProject`/`duplicateProject`), import/export validation (`importProjectJson`/`validateProject`), autosave drafts, favorites, settings, custom themes, the default theme id, and UI-mode persistence. `js/state.js` owns the single mutable `appState` object that `app.js` reads/writes and that `storage.js` serializes.

**Rule:** nothing outside `js/storage.js` calls `localStorage` directly (grep-enforceable). Every write goes through `validateProject`/`normalizeSettings`/`validateTheme`, so a corrupted or hand-edited localStorage value can never silently become a corrupted `appState`.

### 9. Media storage

**Owns:** `js/media.js` (file/type/signature/size validation, SVG sanitization, accessibility warnings, media-reference shape) + `js/media-storage.js` (the IndexedDB `rise-component-builder-media` database, record CRUD, runtime object-URL lifecycle) + `js/media-upload.js` (§3's UI layer over both).

Binary data (Blobs) lives only in IndexedDB. Project/component configuration only ever stores a JSON-safe _reference_ (`{ source: 'upload', mediaId, schemaVersion, kind, name, mimeType, size, createdAt, duration }`) — `js/storage.js`'s `isSafeProjectValue` explicitly rejects any `blob`/`objectUrl` property reaching localStorage. Object URLs are created on demand and revoked on removal/unload; they are never persisted.

**Rule:** `js/preview.js`/`js/export.js` resolve a media reference to a usable URL only through `js/media-storage.js`'s `resolveMediaReference`/`resolveMediaReferencesForPreview` — no module reads `IndexedDB` directly except `media-storage.js`.

### 10. Validation

Validation is intentionally layered, not centralized in one file, because each layer guards a different trust boundary:

### 11. Completion adapter and Rise/LMS communication

**Owns:** the generated document's inline `<script>`, emitted by `js/preview.js` (§4) and composed from `js/export-shell.js` (internal progress/completion) plus `js/completion.js` (the adapter/messaging layer) — and nothing else. The _builder application_ has no network layer and no direct Rise/Moodle/LMS integration at all.

Completion is deliberately split into three separated concepts (full detail, message schema, and exactly what is/isn't verified: `docs/COMPLETION-INTEGRATION.md`):

1. **Internal interaction progress** — `viewedItems`/`updateProgress()` (`js/export-shell.js`): which items have been interacted with, and the visible/ARIA percentage. Only present when `trackCompletion` is on.
2. **Internal component completion** — `evaluateComponentCompletion()` (`js/export-shell.js`): the one-time percent-reaches-100 transition. Purely internal; does not by itself imply any host noticed.
3. **Parent-window notification** — `RiseComponentCompletion` (`js/completion.js`), the only code that touches `window.parent`/`postMessage`. It selects one of three adapters at runtime (standalone/not embedded → internal-only; embedded with `postMessage` available → send; embedded without it → no-op) and sends `{ type: 'complete' }` — Rise's own documented "Vibe Coding" completion contract, verbatim — exactly once, guarded against duplicates. There is no custom envelope and no inbound message of any kind; this is a one-way, fire-and-forget signal.

This entire layer — steps 1–3 — is only emitted when `trackCompletion` is enabled; a component with completion tracking off ships none of this code and registers no `message` listener at all.

There is no other outbound message type and no other channel (no `fetch`, no `XMLHttpRequest`, no `WebSocket`) — consistent with the generated document's CSP (`connect-src 'none'`, `docs/SECURITY.md`). Everything else described as "Rise/LMS" integration in the product docs (embedding the `srcdoc` iframe, pasting the HTML fragment, exporting standalone HTML) is a static-output concern owned by §5, not a live communication channel. Whether Rise, Moodle, SCORM, or xAPI actually consume this message is not verified by this project — see `docs/RISE-COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md` and `docs/COMPLETION-INTEGRATION.md`.

**Rule:** if real bidirectional LMS communication (e.g. reading a learner id, writing a SCORM score, an xAPI statement) is ever added, it must be introduced as a new, explicitly documented adapter matching the interface in `js/completion.js` — not folded into the existing `{ type: 'complete' }` signal or scattered across generator branches.

## Build

**New in this phase.** `npm run build` (`build.mjs`) assembles a `dist/` directory containing exactly the files the browser needs at runtime (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `js/`, `components/`) and verifies every local `<script src>`/`<link href>` reference in `index.html` resolves to a file that was actually copied. It does not bundle, minify, or transpile — there is no framework/bundler in this project by design (§1 architecture premise), and GitHub Pages serves static files directly, so "build" here means "produce a verified, deployable static tree," not "compile." This is intentionally the smallest possible build step that still catches a broken/missing file reference before deployment.

### Cache-busting (`scripts/stamp-cache-busting.mjs`)

GitHub Pages serves the branch root with `Cache-Control: max-age=600` and no hashed filenames, so a returning visitor's browser kept serving a stale `app.js` / `styles.css` / `js/*.js` after a deploy — a half-updated page. `npm run build` (and `npm run stamp`) now runs `scripts/stamp-cache-busting.mjs`, which derives a short token from `js/version.js`'s `APP_VERSION` build metadata (`2.1.0+20260907.1630` → `20260907.1630`) and stamps it into `index.html`:

- `?v=<token>` on the `fonts.css` / `styles.css` / `app.js` references, and
- a generated `<script type="importmap">` (between `BUILD:CACHE-BUSTING` markers) mapping every `./js/*.js` and `./components/*.js` specifier to the same path + `?v=<token>`, so the entire ES module graph is covered without touching the `.js` sources' own clean relative imports.

The stamp is idempotent and committed to the tree; `npm run stamp:check` (a CI step) fails a release that bumped `APP_VERSION` without re-stamping. `index.html` itself stays unversioned — it is left to Pages' `max-age=600`, which reconciles within ten minutes and is CDN-revalidated on each publish. Bumping the release: update `APP_VERSION` in `js/version.js` (and `package.json`), run `npm run stamp` (or `npm run build`), commit both.

## Automated test architecture

Vitest runs module-level and generated-output integration tests; jsdom is used only where DOM parsing is required. V8 coverage gates the directly unit-tested state/storage/theme/utility/modular-generator layers at 70% statements / 60% branches / 70% functions / 70% lines. `tests/unit/generators.test.js` exercises 20 of the 21 components against hostile-input fixtures (`interactive-video` has its own dedicated test file instead — its items are type-discriminated interaction markers, not the uniform `{title, content}` shape this shared loop assumes); `tests/unit/export-isolation.test.js` and `tests/unit/export-determinism.test.js` structurally prove per-component isolation and deterministic/collision-free output (`docs/EXPORT-CONTRACT.md`). Playwright drives Chromium, Firefox, and desktop WebKit against a dependency-free local static server, covering the shell, schema editor, iframe preview, component interactions, persistence, downloads, responsive sizes, and accessibility. Full strategy, browser-specific caveats, and the current commands are in `docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`.

## Important dependencies (who may import whom)

- `app.js` is the central coordinator and is the only module allowed to depend on _every_ other module — it is the composition root.
- `component-registry.js` is the only module that imports every `components/*.js` module directly; `catalog.js` depends only on `component-registry.js`.
- `editor.js` depends on `editor-schemas.js`, `utilities.js` (rich-text sanitization), `media.js`, and `media-upload.js`.
- `preview.js` depends on `themes.js`, `utilities.js`, `media-storage.js`, `export-shell.js`, and the component registry passed in by `app.js` — it does not import `components/*.js` directly, keeping the registry composition decision in `app.js`/`component-registry.js`.
- `export-shell.js` has no dependency on `components/*.js` either — it only assembles pieces `preview.js` hands it.
- `export.js` depends on `utilities.js`, `media.js`, and `media-storage.js`, and consumes (never regenerates) the HTML string produced by `preview.js`.
- `storage.js` depends on `media.js` (`isMediaReference`) and `themes.js` (theme validation) — it defines the project format everything else reads.
- `media-upload.js` depends on `media.js` (validation) and `media-storage.js` (persistence).
- `themes.js` and `utilities.js` have no dependencies on other project modules — they are the leaves of the dependency graph, which is why they carry the highest unit-test coverage requirement.
- `index.html` element IDs and `styles.css` class names are coupled to selectors in `app.js` and `editor.js` (not enforced by any module boundary — a refactor risk called out in `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`).
