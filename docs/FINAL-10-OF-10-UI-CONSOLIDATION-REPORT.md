## 1. Executive Summary & Audit Reconciliation

This corrective implementation pass reconciles all discrepancies between the live deployment and project specifications. Every requirement has been verified in the live running application and automated test suite.

| Requirement Area | Prior Audit State | Corrected Live-Build Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0: 3-Zone Workspace Integration** | Zones visually present but disconnected; component selection did not update Canvas or Inspector; focus editor return lost selection. | **Authoritative workspace selection model** `{ type: 'course'\|'section'\|'component', id: string }`. Clicking any outline row immediately compiles and renders in Live Canvas and updates Contextual Inspector. Focus Editor return restores exact selection, preview, and inspector focus. | **PASSED** |
| **P0: Single Canonical QA Calculation** | Workspace Inspector showed 100% QA health while QA page showed 38% readiness / Not Ready. | **Unified `auditCourseProject(project)` engine** used across Workspace Inspector, Course QA Preflight, Pre-Export Review, and Export gating. Empty courses report *"No content to evaluate"*. Identical technical scores, readiness percentages, and blocker/error counts across all screens. | **PASSED** |
| **P0: Component Registry Truthfulness** | Previous report listed fictitious components (`bullet-list`, `checklist`, `counter-grid`, `voice-recorder`). | **100% Canonical Registry Alignment**: Directly documented from runtime `COMPONENT_REGISTRY` containing the exact 26 AT&T interactive components. | **PASSED** |
| **P1: Modal Accessibility Isolation** | Background application roots were not receiving `inert`; focus leaks on Tab/Shift+Tab. | **Strict `isolateModal()` on `#modal-root`**: `#app-shell` receives `inert="true"` and `aria-hidden="true"`, focus is trapped within dialogs, Escape closes and restores focus to the exact trigger button. | **PASSED** |
| **P1: 4-Card Project Starter Experience** | Live deployment used legacy dropdowns instead of starter cards. | **4-Card Accessible Radio-Card Experience**: *Standard 3-Module Course (Recommended)*, *Blank Course*, *Single Component/Assessment*, and *Import Project JSON*. Supports keyboard `Enter`/`Space` and visible focus rings. | **PASSED** |
| **P1: 2-Column Desktop Component Picker** | Single-column cramped cards; missing reported quick views and wireframes. | **High-Density 2-Column Grid** (`max-width: min(840px, 94vw)`), SVG wireframe thumbnails, Quick Views (*All 26*, *★ Recommended*, *Favorites*, *Recent*), sticky search/destination controls, and polite live region announcements. | **PASSED** |
| **P1: Accurate Compliance Copy** | Unsupported "Certified" claims visible. | **Standardized Industry Copy**: Consistently uses `Designed for Articulate Rise 360`, `Built to support WCAG 2.2 AA requirements`, and `Accessibility Checks Included`. | **PASSED** |
| **P1: Orphaned Helper Text & ARIA Associations** | Global disconnected hint strings mounted outside form contexts. | **Explicit Form Scoping & ARIA Links**: All hint strings mounted strictly beside relevant inputs, linked via `aria-describedby` matching `<p class="field-hint">`, and unmounted/hidden when editor panels are inactive. Zero orphaned global copy. | **PASSED** |
| **P2: Course Preview Pluralization & Sequence Numbering** | First component showed badge `2`; hardcoded "components" in sequence. | **Accurate Sequence Badge & Pluralization**: Sequence numbering begins at `1`, increments per component without section incrementing. Viewport banner dynamically renders `1 component in sequence` / `2 components in sequence` via shared `pluralize()`. | **PASSED** |

## 3. Detailed Requirement Verification Matrix

### P0 — Integrated 3-Zone Workspace

- **Canonical Selection State:** Stored at workspace controller level as `{ selectedType, selectedId }`.
- **Outline Node Accessibility:** Distinct button selection targets (`.workspace-banner-select-target`, `.section-select-target`, `.component-select-target`) with `aria-pressed`, `Enter`/`Space` activation, and visible focus rings. Status dropdown, Focus Edit button, keyboard move buttons, and options menus are independent interactive elements with zero nested button anti-patterns.
- **Live Canvas Preview:** Selected component renders in center canvas using canonical compiler path `compileComponentHtml()`. Supports Desktop, Tablet (768px), and Mobile (375px) device viewport toggles.
- **Contextual Inspector:**
  - *Course Selected*: Course Title, Client Badge, Target (*Designed for Articulate Rise 360*), Editorial Scope, and Pre-Export QA Health.
  - *Section Selected*: Section Title, Description, Component Count, Add Component, Rename, Delete.
  - *Component Selected*: Component Title (live editable), Status (*Draft, In Review, Ready*), Learning Purpose, Standards & Compatibility, Open Focus Editor CTA, Duplicate, Delete.
- **Focus Editor Return Continuity:** Entering Focus Editor saves selected component ID. Returning via "Back to Course" restores component selection, scrolls the row into view, renders in Canvas, and loads component Inspector.

### P0 — Unified QA & Readiness Engine

- `auditCourseProject(project)` returns `{ totalComponents, technicalScore, overallScore, overallStatus, overallStatusClass, editorial: { draftCount, inReviewCount, readyCount }, counts }`.
- Used identically across Workspace Inspector, Course QA Preflight, Pre-Export Review, and Export gating.
- Empty courses report *"No content to evaluate"* with disabled export triggers.
- Tested across regression fixtures: Empty project (0%), 1 Draft component (Not Ready), 1 In Review component (In Progress), 1 Ready component (100% / Ready to Export), and Blocker projects.

### P1 — Modal Accessibility Isolation

- Modals mounted into `#modal-root` outside `#app-shell`.
- When modal opens, `#app-shell` receives `inert=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`. Background controls cannot receive focus.
- Forward Tab and Reverse Shift+Tab wrap within active modal.
- Escape key closes modal and returns focus to the exact trigger button.
- Verified across: New Project Modal, Component Library Drawer, Component Details Modal, and Pre-Export Review.

### P1 — 4-Card Project Starter Experience

- New Project modal provides 4 visual cards with keyboard activation:
  1. *Standard 3-Module Course (Recommended)*
  2. *Blank Course*
  3. *Single Component/Assessment*
  4. *Import Project JSON*

### P1 — Component Library Drawer & Quick Views

- Desktop width uses a responsive 2-column card grid (`max-width: min(840px, 94vw)`).
- Quick Views: *All (26)*, *★ Recommended*, *Favorites* (persisted to `rise-builder-favorites-v1`), and *Recent*.
- Wireframe SVG previews for all 26 components.
- Sticky search and destination section controls.

### P1 — Compliance Copy & Orphaned Text Cleanup

- All certification claims replaced with `Designed for Articulate Rise 360`, `Built to support WCAG 2.2 AA requirements`, and `Accessibility Checks Included`.
- All form helper text connected via `aria-describedby` with zero orphaned global text.

### P2 — Course Preview Sequence Numbering

- Sequence badge counter initialized to `0` and increments only when rendering components (`compCounter++`).
- Sequence badges start at `1` and continue sequentially across sections and unsectioned areas. Section headers do not increment component numbering.

## 7. Sign-Off Statement

All verified discrepancies have been fully resolved in both the source implementation and the production build. The three-zone workspace operates as an integrated authoring environment, readiness metrics are unified across all screens, accessibility isolation is strictly enforced with background `inert`, and all documentation truthfully reflects the deployed application.
