# Testing the Rise Component Builder

This is the practical how-to guide. For the *why* behind the pyramid, coverage scope, and the E2E browser-matrix status, see [`docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`](docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md).

## Installation

Install the pinned development dependencies from the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
```

Use `npm install` only when intentionally updating dependencies and the lockfile. The application remains vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; npm is used only for test tooling.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Run all Vitest unit and integration tests once |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run all Vitest unit and integration tests once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in interactive watch mode |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Chromium browser, interaction, persistence, export, responsive, and accessibility tests |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Open Playwright's interactive test UI |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run Vitest with V8 coverage and enforce quality gates |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint over application and test code |
| `npm run format` | Apply Prettier formatting |
| `npm run format:check` | Check Prettier formatting without writing (CI-safe) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` against JSDoc-typed `.js` files (incremental, see `docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`) |
| `npm run build` | Assemble and verify the static `dist/` tree for deployment |
| `npm run validate` | Run lint, typecheck, coverage, and build in one CI-friendly gate |

Coverage thresholds are 70% statements, 60% branches, 70% functions, and 70% lines. HTML and JSON summary reports are written to `coverage/`.

```

Vitest runs in Node by default. Unit tests that require DOM parsing import jsdom directly. Playwright runs the unbundled application from `http://127.0.0.1:4173` using the local test server.

## Writing unit tests

1. Put focused module tests in `tests/unit/*.test.js`.
2. Import reusable values from `tests/fixtures/index.js` rather than recreating projects and hostile strings.
3. Prefer observable behavior over implementation details.
4. Use the in-memory localStorage fixture for persistence tests and clean any added globals.
5. For component generators, validate HTML with jsdom, compile JavaScript with `Function`, and check escaping and empty/many-item boundaries.
6. Run both `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:coverage` before submitting changes.

Do not add assertions that merely execute lines without verifying useful behavior.

## Writing Playwright tests

1. Put browser workflows in the closest `tests/e2e/*.spec.js` file.
2. Prefer stable IDs, roles, labels, and existing component text over CSS layout selectors.
3. Use `frameLocator('#live-preview-iframe')` for generated component interactions.
4. Keep persistence-dependent actions in one test or one context; Playwright creates a clean context for each test.
5. Capture downloads through `page.waitForEvent('download')` and exercise downloaded output in a separate page when relevant.
6. Add axe rules only when they express the intended requirement; do not suppress violations without documenting the reason.
7. Add a trace-friendly assertion close to every state transition.

Key shell/editor flows run at 1440×900, 1024×768, 768×1024, and 375×812. Chromium is the initial CI browser; additional browser projects can be added once cross-browser differences are triaged.

## Debugging failures

- Re-run one unit file: `npx vitest run tests/unit/storage.test.js`.
- Re-run one browser file: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/interactions.spec.js`.
- Re-run by name: `npx playwright test --grep "accordion"`.
- Open the Playwright UI: `npm run test:e2e:ui`.
- View a retained trace: `npx playwright show-trace test-results/<test-name>/trace.zip`.
- Open the last HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`.
- Inspect screenshots and videos in `test-results/` after failures.

If the local server port is occupied, stop the existing process or set `PORT=4173` for a manually started `node tests/e2e/server.mjs`. CI always starts an isolated server.

## Snapshots

No visual or text snapshots are currently used. This is intentional: the tests assert semantics and behavior without normalizing large generated documents. If snapshots are introduced later, review the actual diff before updating with `npx vitest -u` or `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`. Never update snapshots solely to make a failure disappear.

## Accessibility scope and manual checks

Automated checks cover accessible names and labels, selected ARIA relationships and states, tab semantics, keyboard traversal, focus indicators, reduced motion, media-alt authoring warnings, and configured color-contrast reporting. axe-core is used where it can reliably inspect the builder DOM.

Automation does not replace these manual checks:

- Screen-reader testing with NVDA/JAWS on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS/iOS
- Browser zoom and text-only zoom through 200–400%
- High-contrast and forced-colors modes
- Keyboard behavior in every modal; focus trapping and focus restoration remain tracked gaps
- Contrast over uploaded imagery and arbitrary rich-text combinations
- Captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions with real instructional media
- Cognitive load, instruction clarity, and correctness of authored alternatives

## Manual Rise testing still required

Standalone, iframe, and fragment output must still be tested manually inside supported Articulate Rise blocks. Verify iframe sizing, CSP/sandbox behavior, focus movement between Rise and the component, course navigation, completion expectations, hosted media paths, and the exact publishing/LMS environment. Automated local-browser tests cannot reproduce Rise's editor or hosted runtime.

## Moodle/SCORM testing — out of scope

Moodle compatibility and SCORM packaging are not goals of this project — it targets Rise 360 delivery only (deliberate decision, `docs/RISE-COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md` "Scope", `docs/COMPATIBILITY-RESULTS.md`, 2026-08-12). `docs/MOODLE-SCORM-TEST-CHECKLIST.md` is kept for reference only, in case that scope ever changes. No Moodle or SCORM deployment is performed by this repository.

## CI behavior

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` installs pinned dependencies, runs unit tests and coverage, installs Playwright Chromium, runs E2E tests against the local server, and uploads coverage plus retained Playwright failure artifacts. It does not assume a public deployment.
